Hello! I'm Adena, a high school senior based in Connecticut!

I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.

I currently attend the Academy of Information Iechnolgy and Engineering.
